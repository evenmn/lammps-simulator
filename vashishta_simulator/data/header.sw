# LAMMPS reads the ones it needs
# these entries are in LAMMPS "metal" units:
# epsilon = eV; sigma = Angstroms
# other quantities are unitless
# format of a single entry (one or more lines):
# element 1, element 2, element 3,
# epsilon, sigma, a, lambda, gamma, costheta0, A, B, p, q, tol
# Here are the original parameters in metal units, for Silicon from:
#
# Stillinger and Weber, Phys. Rev. B, v. 31, p. 5262, (1985)
